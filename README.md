### API Integration

The application integrates with two external APIs:

   - No authentication required
   - Returns: `{ "fact": "string", "length": number }`

2. **CATAAS API** (https://cataas.com/cat)
   - Provides random cat images
   - Timestamp parameter used to ensure fresh images on each request
   - Direct image URL response

### File Structure

```

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cat.png         # Favicon and local cat image
```

## Usage
